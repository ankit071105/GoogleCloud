# Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions with Vertex AI: Challenge Lab || [GSP354](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/22019?parent=catalog) ||

## Solution

* Go to `Workbench` from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench?)

* Download `Jupyter` file from [here](https://github.com/QUICK-GCP-LAB/2-Minutes-Labs-Solutions/blob/main/Build%20and%20Deploy%20Machine%20Learning%20Solutions%20with%20Vertex%20AI%20Challenge%20Lab/vertex-challenge-lab-v1.0.0.ipynb)

1. In your notebook, click the **Terminal**.

2. Install the required packages for the lab:
```
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt --user
```
3. In the **File Browser** on the left, click on the **vertex-challenge-lab-v1.0.0.ipynb** file.

4. When asked which kernel to use, select the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** kernel.

### Now follow [video's](https://youtu.be/6jqBe2o6jPM) instructions for tasks 3,4 & 5.

> *Note: This training can take around **30-40** minutes to train and deploy the model.*

### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ for Completing the Lab !

##### *You Have Successfully Demonstrated Your Skills And Determination.*

#### *WellÂ done!*
